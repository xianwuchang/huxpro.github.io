1.In a sense, this is the opposite case from our textile business where even very good management probably can average only modest results.  One of the lessons your management has learned - and, unfortunately, sometimes re-learned - is the importance of being in businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds.
从某种意义上说，纺织是企业相反的情况，即使是非常好的管理，也只能取得微薄的成果。您的管理层所学到的一个教训 - 不幸的是，有时重新学习 在顺风而不是逆风而行的企业中的重要性。

We want the business to be (1) one that we can understand, (2) with favorable long-term prospects, (3) operated by honest and competent people, and (4) available at a very attractive price. We ordinarily make no attempt to buy equities for anticipated favorable stock price behavior in the short term. In fact, if their business experience continues to satisfy us, we welcome lower market prices of stocks we own as an opportunity to acquire even more of a good thing at a better price.
2.选择投资企业的基础条件：

- 投资我们能理解的企业
- 所投资企业具有良好的前景
- 这些企业由诚实、能干的人管理
- 非常具有吸引力的价格
我们不会因为短期价格变化而购买资产，如果公司业绩不断令我们满意，我们愿意用更好的价格获得好的企业。

When prices are appropriate, we are willing to take very large positions in selected companies, not with any intention of taking control and not foreseeing sell-out or merger, but with the expectation that excellent business results by corporations will translate over the long term into correspondingly excellent market value and dividend results for owners, minority as well as majority.
3.当价格合适的时候，我们愿意在选定的公司中担任很大的职位，而不是有任何控制意图，也不是预测出售或合并，而是期望公司出色的经营业绩能够长期转化为相对优秀的市场价值和分红业绩，对拥有者、少数以及多数股东。

While control would give us the opportunity - and the 
responsibility - to manage operations and corporate resources, we 
would not be able to provide management in either of those 
respects equal to that now in place. In effect, we can obtain a 
better management result through non-control than control. This 
is an unorthodox view, but one we believe to be sound.
4.尽管控制权给我们管理运营和公司资源的机会和责任，但是我们无法提供与现在相同的管理。实际上，通过非控制而不是控制，我们可以获得更好的管理效果。这是一个非正统的观点，但我们认为是一个健全的观点。

Most of our large stock positions are going to be held for many years and the scorecard on our investment decisions will be provided by business results over that period, and not by prices on any given day. Just as it would be foolish to focus unduly on short-term prospects when acquiring an entire company, we think it equally unsound to become mesmerized by prospective near term earnings or recent trends in earnings when purchasing small pieces of a company.
5.我们大部分大型股票仓位将持续多年，而我们投资决策的计分卡将由该期间的业绩提供，而不是任何一天的价格。正如在收购整个公司时过分关注短期前景是愚蠢的，我们认为，在购买小公司时，可能会被潜在的近期收益或最近的收益趋势迷住。
